    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This pumpkin roll recipe is a pinwheel-like dessert, best served chilled, made of spiced pumpkin cake with
        spirals of cream cheese filling inside. This may seem like a complicated
        bake, but rest assured it's much easier than you think! There are only two ground rules, be <i>very</i> gentle
        while rolling, and watch the cooking time. Keeping the cake moist and springy is key to successful, uncracked
        spirals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a few simple tips before we start: Your cream cheese frosting should be a bit stiff, so it doesn't
        squeeze out when you roll the cake out, but too much stiffness can tear the cake as you spread the frosting
        on. Sounds tricky, but just remember the principle: We want to be able to safely roll the cake around
        the frosting, without any cracks or runaway frosting. Let's begin!
